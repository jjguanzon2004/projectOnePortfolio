                    <h1>My name is Jonjon Guanzon!</h1>
                <p> I'm in my third year at SFSU and majoring in Visual Communciation Design. I'm pretty new <br> to Web Design 
                and coding, so initially I felt intimidated. At times, it does feel tedious to <br> remember the syntax. I know we're in
                the early stages of the semester, but regardless I've been <br> having a lot of fun!</p>     
                    
                <p>As for my background, I'm a second-generation Filipino American. My parents and grandma <br> immigrated to America in the
                late 90's, along with the rest of my family on my mom's side. <br> Since then, they've resided in Hayward where they gave 
                birth to my siblings and I. They tried <br> teaching me Tagalog when I was young, but I never got aournd to speaking it. 
                Regardless, I <br> stil enjoy the other aspects of my Filipino heritage, like the food, the community, and <br> traditions.</p>

                <p>I'm introverted, so I try to avoid things that drain my social battery. I still like talking to <br> friends, going out
                to places, exploring new food spots, thrifting, and gaming. But I prefer <br> doing it around people I'm comfortable with. 
                I also like listening to music. Throughout the <br> day, you may see me with headphones on for hours at a time. To be honest,
                I'm not sure how <br> to describe my music taste. I sort of just enjoy music from any genre. But currently, I've been <br> trying
                to get into Japanese music, like Japanese Pop.</p>
