            <img src="img/gambino.jpeg" alt="Close up of Chidish Gambino, showing no emotion, wearing as 
                floral shirt, against a red and pink background">
                <h5>What inspires me about Gambino is his artistic vision. Initially, I listened to his 
                    album "Because the Internet." Eventually, I branched to other areas of his work with
                    shows like Atlanta and Community. He isn't afraid to experiment anbd explore new things,
                    which is something I admire and strive to become. </h5>

                tired expression. The Word 'DAMN' is placed above him in bold and red letters"></a>
                <h5>What inspires me about Kendrick is his transparency and attentino to detail. I've always 
                    enjoyed his music, but the more I lsten and examine the lyrics, the easier it is to 
                    resonate with him. He speaks about growing up in Compton, surrounded by the influences of
                    gang culture, racism, and violence.</h5>

                <h5>Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated with the characters and world design of 
                    Star Wars. It includes many things unlike our own world such as lightsabers, snow planets,
                    Jedi, and the force. But at its core, Star Wars represents real world issues, events, 
                    movements, and unique stores thaat I didn't realize until I was in my teens. It
                    made me appreciate the franchise even more.
